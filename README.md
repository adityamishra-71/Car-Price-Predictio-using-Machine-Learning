# Car-Price-Predictio-using-Machine-Learning
ML problem
A Car company has provided user-inputted text descriptions of its products, including details like product category name, brand name, item condition and other required data or feature of a car. Using this data, we have to come up with a model that predicts the price of a car listed on car company as accurately as possible. This looks like a standard regression problem.

I've built a Price predicting module based on supervised machine learning, with the help of various regression tools.
Though this is the most simple model weâ€™ve to built, the final predictors still seem to have high correlations. One can go ahead and remove some of these features, though that will affect the adjusted-r2 score significantly.
Thus, for now, the final model consists of the 7 variables mentioned above.
